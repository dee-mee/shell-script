This is a script that works on ubuntu fresh 
install systems which contains
only basic software installations.

first change the script to executable:

      chmod +x install.sh

then run the script as root user for easier flow:

      sudo ./install.sh
      
the script then flows and install the listed packages.
the examples of the packages are :
      #vlc
      #htop
      #whatsapp-for-linux
      #sl
      #cowsay
      #net-tools
looking to create more scripts which will eventually be repetitive background processes 
without much interaction from the user.


NOTE : THE SCRIPT IS AUTOMATICALLY DELETED AFTER FINISHING EXECUTION.
here are screenshots of how it works!
