This is a script that works on ubuntu fresh 
install systems which contains
only basic software installations.
Its assumed that you know how to run scripts using the terminal.
if not first change the script to executable:
      #chmod +x install.sh

      then run the script as root user for easier flow:

      #sudo su
      #./install.sh
the script then flows and install the listed packages.
the examples of the packages are :
      #vlc
      #htop
      #whatsapp-for-linux
      #sl
      #cowsay
      #net-tools
looking to create more scripts which will evntually be repetitive background processes 
without much interaction from the user.


NOTE : THE SCRIPT IS AUTOMATICALLY DELETED AFTER FINISHING EXECUTION.
